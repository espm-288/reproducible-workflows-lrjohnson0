## Libraries

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
## Set up the bits to do the github actions -- 
## these don't need to run every time, just make the infrastructure once
## These will go along into the git repo, so that everything works
##
## library(usethis) # adding for reproducibility bits with github
## ?usethis::use_github_action()
## usethis::use_github_action("render-rmarkdown.yaml")
```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
mtcars |> ggplot(aes(cyl, mpg)) + geom_point()
```
